The experiment consist of two main parts.
This is the part I. Part II will take place on MM/DD days and will have the name "XXX".
Both parts will take about 10-15 minutes each.
You will get a participation fee for the completion of both parts. Additionally, you will get the opportunity to earn bonus payments in both parts.
The participation fee and the bonuses will be paid out at the end of the second part.
